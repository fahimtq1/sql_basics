# SQL Basics

This repository showcases my skills in Structured Query Language (SQL). The following topics have been covered in my SQL course and are demonstrated in the accompanying challenge and assessment files:

## Basic SQL Syntax
- SELECT statement: used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.
- SELECT DISTINCT statement: used to retrieve unique values from a column in a table.
- COUNT: used to count the number of rows in a table.
- SELECT WHERE: used to retrieve data from a table based on specific conditions.
- ORDER BY: used to sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order.
- LIMIT: used to limit the number of rows returned by a query.
- BETWEEN: used to retrieve data based on a range of values in a column.
- IN: used to retrieve data based on multiple specific values in a column.
- LIKE and ILIKE: used to retrieve data based on patterns in a column.

## Advanced SQL Concepts
- Aggregation functions: used to perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single value.
- GROUP BY: used to group rows with similar values in a column and perform aggregate functions on each group.
- HAVING: used to specify conditions for the groups returned by a `GROUP BY` clause.
- JOINS: used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.
- TIMESTAMPS: used to store date and time values in a database.
- SubQuery: used to embed a SELECT statement within another SELECT statement.
- Primary and foreign keys: used to establish relationships between tables in a database.
- Creating a database and tables: used to create a new database and tables to store data.
- Case: used to specify multiple conditions in a query and return different values based on those conditions.
